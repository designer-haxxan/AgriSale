# AgriSale POS

Offline-first, mobile-first Point of Sale for **fertilizer, pesticide and seed dealers**, as a static PWA (no build step).
HTML5 · ES modules · jQuery · Bootstrap 5 · Bootstrap Icons · IndexedDB · Service Worker · eposwala login API.

## Agri features

- **Batches & expiry.** Every purchase line records a batch no., expiry date and (optionally) manufacturing date. Products flagged *Has batches with expiry dates* (pesticides, seeds…) cannot be purchased without an expiry date. Plain fertilizers can turn this off.
- **FEFO selling (First-Expiry-First-Out).** A sale automatically takes stock from the batch that expires first, splitting a line across batches when needed. Expired batches are skipped and cannot be picked; this can be allowed under *Settings → Batches, expiry & credit*. A specific batch can still be chosen on a cart line.
- **Batch-aware returns.** Sale returns go back into the batches the goods were sold from. Purchase returns come out of the batch that purchase created. Receipts, invoices and WhatsApp messages show the batch and expiry of each line.
- **Expiry control.** The *Expiry & batches* screen lists expired and expiring stock (the warning window is configurable, 60 days by default) with a one-tap **write off** via a stock adjustment. The dashboard shows expired / expiring counts. The *Expiry & batch stock* and *Batch traceability* reports tell you which farmer received which batch, for recalls.
- **Product details.** Company/brand, active ingredient / formulation, pack size, registration no. All of them are searchable in the POS.
- **Credit with due dates.** Credit sales can carry a due date (quick 30/90/180-day buttons, or a default credit period). The *Credit aging / overdue* report and each customer page list unpaid bills. Payments and returns are applied to the oldest bill first.
- **WhatsApp messages** (see below): invoices, returns, payment receipts, balance/credit reminders, ledger statements, and owner alerts (daily summary, expiry, low stock).

## General features

- **POS sales**: search, camera/hardware barcode scan, cart with qty/rate/discount, bill discount, tax, cash/bank/credit/partial payments, change calculation, hold/resume, edit, void, returns, receipt printing. The cart survives page refresh.
- **Purchases**: suppliers, purchase rate, discount, paid/remaining, edit, void, returns. Can update product cost from the latest purchase.
- **Products & categories**: SKU, barcode (scan or generate EAN-13), unit, purchase/sale/wholesale prices, opening/min stock, compressed images, services (no stock).
- **Customers & suppliers**: contact info, opening balance, ledger/statement (print), payments.
- **Accounts / cash book**: cash, bank/wallet, income, expense, asset, liability accounts. Receipts, payments and transfers use double-entry ledger entries.
- **Stock**: current stock, low/out-of-stock, stock ledger per product, adjustments (add/remove/set count) with void.
- **Reports** (print + CSV): daily sales, sales by range, sales/purchase returns, product-wise sales/purchases, customer/supplier ledgers, receivables, payables, cash book, account ledger, daily closing, stock (as of date), profit summary.
- **Backup & restore**: versioned JSON with checksum, validation preview, replace or merge.
- **PWA**: installable, works fully offline after the first online login.

### Storage

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| IndexedDB `saleapp_pos` (v2) | All business data: products, categories, customers, suppliers, accounts, sales + items, purchases + items, returns, vouchers, **ledger entries**, **stock moves**, **batches**, adjustments, held sales, WhatsApp message log (`waLog`), audit log, counters |
| LocalStorage | Settings (business profile, tax, prefixes, printer, theme), device preferences, `minipos.session` (`{ token, expiresAt, username }`), `minipos.deviceId`, POS cart drafts |

**Data integrity.** Each operation (sale, purchase, return, voucher, adjustment, edit, void) runs in **one IndexedDB transaction**. That transaction writes:

- the document and its lines
- stock moves and the cached product stock
- balanced double-entry ledger entries (the transaction is refused if they don't balance)
- the invoice counter
- the audit record

Any failure aborts everything. Document IDs are generated when the cart is created, so a double tap or a retry after a refresh is detected as a duplicate instead of saving twice. Invoice numbers (`SALE-000001`…) come from a counter inside the same transaction, backed by a unique index. Failed transactions don't consume numbers.

**Balances and reports are always derived from records.** Customer, supplier and account balances come from ledger entries. Stock-as-of-date comes from stock moves. The cached `product.stock` is updated in the same transaction and can be checked or rebuilt under *Settings → App & data*.

**Batches.** Every stock move of a stock-tracked product carries a `batchId`. A batch's `qty` is a cache of the sum of its moves, exactly like `product.stock`, and *Check data integrity* / *Recalculate stock* verify and rebuild both. Opening stock (and all stock that existed before v2) lives in the product's opening batch `ob:<productId>`. Upgrading a v1 database moves existing stock into that batch automatically, and restoring a v1 backup does the same. Sale lines store their batch allocation (`saleItems[].batches`), so cost of goods sold uses the actual batch costs.

### WhatsApp

Messages are sent with WhatsApp **click-to-chat** links. The app writes the message and opens WhatsApp (the app on phones, WhatsApp Web on computers, configurable) with the chat and text filled in, and the user presses **Send**. This needs no server, no WhatsApp Business API account and no per-message fees. It works with the shop's normal WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business number.

- **Where:** *Send on WhatsApp* after each sale; buttons on sale, return and cash-book (receipt/payment) pages; *WhatsApp* menu on each customer/supplier (reminder, ledger statement for the selected period, blank message); the **WhatsApp** screen with credit reminders (one tap each, or *Send one by one* through the whole list), owner alerts and a log of sent messages.
- **Numbers:** local numbers such as `0300-1234567` become `923001234567` using the country code in *Settings → WhatsApp*. Customers can have a separate WhatsApp number.
- **Templates:** every message type has an editable template with placeholders (`{name}`, `{total}`, `{account_balance}`, `{due_date}`…), including Urdu text. Lines whose placeholders are empty are left out.
- **Limits:** browsers only allow one WhatsApp window per click, so bulk reminders are sent one after another rather than in the background. Truly automatic sending (without anyone pressing Send) needs the WhatsApp Business Cloud API and a server, which this offline app doesn't have. Messages are text; for a PDF statement, print to PDF and attach it in WhatsApp.

### Authentication

Login uses the eposwala API (`CONFIG.AUTH_API_BASE`, default `https://eposwala.com/api`):

```
POST /api/login   Content-Type: application/json
{ "username": "...", "password": "...", "deviceId": "..." }
2xx  → { "token": "...", "expiresAt": <unix ms>, "username": "..." }
!2xx → { "error": "missing_fields" | "invalid_credentials" | "device_mismatch" | "account_disabled" }
```

- **Login requires internet.** Each error code is shown as a specific message; anything else shows "Login failed. Try again."
- **One device per account.** `deviceId` is a UUID created once per browser and stored in `localStorage["minipos.deviceId"]`. The server binds the account to it, and logging out does not remove the binding. Moving to another phone goes through support (`CONFIG.SUPPORT_PHONE`).
- **Session.** `{ token, expiresAt, username }` is stored verbatim in `localStorage["minipos.session"]`. The POS works offline, including across restarts, until `expiresAt`. When it passes, the app returns to the login screen, both at startup and during use (checked every minute and on every navigation). Passwords are never stored.
- **Logout** only clears the local session; the API has no logout endpoint.
- **Permissions.** The logged-in account is the shop owner and gets every POS function. If the server ever adds a `role` field (`manager` / `cashier`) to the login response, the app's role permissions apply automatically.

### Offline behaviour

- The service worker precaches the shell, every module, icons, CDN libraries and the icon fonts. The app loads with no network at all.
- All POS work (sales, purchases, stock, payments, ledgers, reports, printing, scanning, backup) runs entirely on local data.
- The status badge shows **Online / Offline**.
- The app asks the browser for **persistent storage** so data is not evicted.

## Setup

### 1. Login API

Set `AUTH_API_BASE` and `SUPPORT_PHONE` in `js/config.js` if they differ from the defaults.

**CORS:** `https://eposwala.com/api/login` currently sends no CORS headers. Browsers can therefore only call it from pages served by **https://eposwala.com** itself. To run the app from another origin, including `localhost`, the API must return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for that origin and answer the `OPTIONS` preflight with `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type`.

### 2. Run locally

The app needs to be served over HTTP (ES modules and service worker). `localhost` counts as a secure context. Login from `localhost` only works once the API allows that origin (see CORS above).

```bash
python -m http.server 8765
```

Then open http://localhost:8765.

### 3. Deploy

**GitHub Pages:** this repository is served from branch `main`, folder `/ (root)` (*Settings → Pages*), at https://designer-haxxan.github.io/AgriSale/. All paths are relative, so the app works from that sub-path. `.nojekyll` makes Pages serve the files unchanged. Login from `github.io` only works once the eposwala API allows the origin `https://designer-haxxan.github.io` (see CORS above).


Host the folder on **https://eposwala.com** (e.g. an IIS site or virtual directory next to `/api`), or on any other HTTPS host once the API allows that origin. **HTTPS is required** for the service worker, camera and Web Bluetooth.

When you change any file, bump `VERSION` in `service-worker.js`. Installed clients will then show an "Update" prompt. New files must also be added to its `SHELL` list.

## Backup & restore

- **Export** downloads one JSON file:
  ```json
  { "format", "backupVersion", "appVersion", "schemaVersion", "createdAt", "createdBy", "counts", "checksum", "settings", "data": { ... } }
  ```
  `data` holds every collection. `checksum` is a SHA-256 of the data. No credentials are included.
- **Import** validates everything before any data changes:
  - JSON structure
  - format and backup/schema versions
  - IDs and required fields for each record
  - duplicate records or document numbers
  - record counts against the header (detects truncation)
  - checksum (detects corruption or tampering)
  - ledger balance
  
  You then see the backup date and record counts. You can optionally download a safety backup first, then choose:
  - **Replace**: erases local data and loads the backup. You must type `REPLACE` to confirm. It runs in one transaction, so a failure leaves the existing data untouched.
  - **Merge**: adds missing records and updates records that are newer in the backup. Documents are merged together with their lines, ledger entries and stock moves, so edited documents are never double-counted. Document-number conflicts are skipped and listed. Stock caches are recomputed afterwards.

## Printing & scanning support

| Capability | Where it works | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web Bluetooth ESC/POS (58/80 mm) | Chrome/Edge on Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS (HTTPS) | Only **BLE** printers; most cheap "classic Bluetooth SPP" printers are not reachable from browsers. Not available in Safari, Firefox or any iOS browser. Known printer channels are tried first (18F0/2AF1, E781…/BEF8…, ISSC 4953…, FF00/FF02, AE30/AE01, FFE0/FFE1, FEE7/FEC7), then blind discovery. Data goes out in 20-byte chunks by default, with acknowledged writes when the printer supports them (Settings → Transfer speed: 20/100/180 bytes). Connecting retries 3×. The printer reconnects silently via `getDevices()` / `watchAdvertisements()` where supported. Print jobs are queued. |
| RawBT | Android | Free RawBT app bridges ESC/POS data to classic Bluetooth, USB and network printers. |
| Browser print | Everywhere | Uses 58/80 mm receipt CSS; works with AirPrint, system print services and PDF. Also used automatically as a fallback. |
| Camera scanning | HTTPS on Android/iOS/desktop | Uses the native `BarcodeDetector` when available (Chrome Android), otherwise lazy-loads `html5-qrcode`. Camera permission errors show guidance and a manual-entry field. |
| Hardware scanners | Everywhere | USB/Bluetooth HID "keyboard wedge" scanners work in the search field and anywhere on the POS screen (fast keystrokes + Enter). |

## Known limitations

- **Data lives on the device.** There is no multi-device cloud sync of POS data. Use backups regularly; the dashboard reminds you after 7 days. To combine data from several devices, give each device different number prefixes (*Settings*) and use **Merge**.
- **Anyone with physical access can read local data.** The offline session gate is client-side. A person with the device and developer tools can read IndexedDB. Use device lock screens.
- **No user management in the app.** Accounts, passwords, device resets and disabling are handled on the eposwala server side. The API has no endpoints for them.
- **Cost of goods sold uses batch costs.** Each sale line records the cost of the batches it was taken from. Stock that existed before v2 carries the product's purchase price at upgrade time.
- **WhatsApp sending is not automatic.** See *WhatsApp* above.
- **iOS has no Web Bluetooth.** Print via AirPrint or the browser dialog instead.
